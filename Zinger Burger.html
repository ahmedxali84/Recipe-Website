    <h2><u>What is zinger Burger</u></h2>
    <p>The zinger is to denote the spicy hot flavor of the breading. This is probably the result of a year long effort by dozens of highly paid sales and marketing executives. 
        After a year someone said “so what do we do boss?” The boss says, “sprinkle some cayenne on it and call it a zinger burger.”</p>
    <h2><u>Why is Zinger Burger So Good</u></h2>
    <p>The jalapenos made it a lot better and the patty was crunchy. The sauce was tangy, which combined with the salad and the patty, made a combination worth spending your money on.
     Texas Zinger is probably the best one out of the new collection of Zinger burgers. The burger patty is the same as the other ones.</p>
     <h2><u>Which Country Invented Zinger Burger</u></h2>
     <p>It has enjoyed popularity across the globe since its inception in Trinidad and Tobago in 1984. More Zingers are sold in the UK, India and Australia than anywhere else. Australia
         alone sells more than 22 million Zingers each year.</p>
