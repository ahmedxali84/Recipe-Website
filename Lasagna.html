    <h2><u>What Is Lasagna</u></h2>
    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. 
    The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices. </p>
    <h2><u>Why Lasagna Is Good</u></h2>
    <p>Lasagna combines rich flavors with a satisfying mix of textures, making it a classic comfort food. It's versatile, allowing for endless customization to suit various
     tastes and dietary needs. Leftovers often taste even better, adding to its appeal. Its layered structure and golden top also make it visually appealing.</p>
     <h2><u>Which Country Invented Lasagna</u></h2>
     <p>Lasagna originated in Italy. The dish has ancient roots, with versions of layered pasta dishes being mentioned in Roman and Greek texts, but the lasagna as we know it
     today was developed in Italy during the Middle Ages. The word "lasagna" itself comes from the Greek "lasanon," meaning chamber pot, which was later borrowed by the Romans to describe a cooking pot, and eventually came to refer to the dish cooked in such a pot.</p>

                        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and lay them flat on a clean surface to prevent sticking.</li>

                        <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley. Mix well.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <li>
                        <b>Assemble the Lasagna:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                            <li>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce.</li>
                            <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                            <li>Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
                            <li>Add another layer of meat sauce on top of the cheese mixture.</li>
                            <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce) until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce.</li>
                            <li>Top with the remaining 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Bake The Lasagna</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the underside of the foil with a bit of cooking spray).</li>
                            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Rest and Serve:</b>

                                <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before cutting and serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
